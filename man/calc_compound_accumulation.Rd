\usage{
calc_compound_accumulation(
  C,
  i,
  t,
  verbose = getOption("BizDecisionMath.verbose", FALSE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{C}{Numeric. The principal amount (initial capital).}

\item{i}{Numeric. The annual interest rate (as decimal).}

\item{t}{Numeric. The time in years.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, displays exam-style calculation steps.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The final accumulated value M.
}
\description{
Calculates the final value (M) of a principal invested at compound interest.
Compound interest means interest is earned on both principal AND accumulated interest.
}
\details{
**Mathematical Formula:**
\deqn{M = C \times (1 + i)^t}

**Key Properties of Compound Interest:**
- Interest grows exponentially with time
- Decomposable: can split time periods
- Standard for medium/long-term investments
- (1 + i)^t is the accumulation factor

**Relationship to Present Value:**
M = C × (1+i)^t ⟺ C = M × (1+i)^(-t)

\examples{
# Basic usage: 1000€ at 5\% for 10 years
calc_compound_accumulation(C = 1000, i = 0.05, t = 10)
# Returns: 1628.89

# Compare with simple interest
calc_compound_accumulation(C = 1000, i = 0.05, t = 10)  # 1628.89
calc_simple_accumulation(C = 1000, i = 0.05, t = 10)    # 1500.00

# Exam problem: Long-term investment
# An investor deposits 50,000€ at 4\% compound interest for 5 years.
# What is the final value?
calc_compound_accumulation(C = 50000, i = 0.04, t = 5, verbose = TRUE)
