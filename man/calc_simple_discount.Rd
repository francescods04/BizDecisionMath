\title{Simple Discount (Present Value)}
\usage{
calc_simple_discount(
  S,
  i,
  t,
  verbose = getOption("BizDecisionMath.verbose", FALSE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{Numeric. The nominal/future value to be discounted.}

\item{i}{Numeric. The simple annual interest rate (decimal).}

\item{t}{Numeric. The time in years until the amount is received.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, displays step-by-step calculation.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The present value A.
}
\description{
Calculates the present value (A) of a future amount using simple discount.
This is the inverse operation of simple accumulation.
}
\details{
**Mathematical Formula:**
\deqn{A = \frac{S}{1 + i \times t}}

**Use Cases:**
- Discounting short-term receivables
- Calculating the price of Treasury bills
- Present value of amounts due within one year

**Relationship to Accumulation:**
If M = C × (1 + it), then C = M / (1 + it)
}
\examples{
# Basic usage: Present value of 1100€ due in 2 years at 5\%
calc_simple_discount(S = 1100, i = 0.05, t = 2)
# Returns: 1000

# Exam problem: Treasury bill pricing
# A T-bill with face value 10,000€ matures in 90 days.
# Market rate is 4\%. What is its price?
calc_simple_discount(S = 10000, i = 0.04, t = 90/365)
