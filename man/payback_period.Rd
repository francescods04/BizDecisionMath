\title{Payback Period}
\usage{
payback_period(cash_flows, times = NULL, i = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{cash_flows}{Numeric vector. Cash flows including initial investment.}

\item{times}{Numeric vector. Times corresponding to cash flows.}

\item{i}{Numeric. Discount rate (0 for simple payback, >0 for discounted).}
}
\value{
Numeric. The payback period (interpolated). Returns NA if never pays back.
}
\description{
Calculates the time required to recover the initial investment.
Supports both simple (undiscounted) and discounted payback period.
}
\details{
**Definition:**
The payback period is the time at which cumulative cash flows equal zero.

**Types:**
- Simple Payback (i = 0): Ignores time value of money
- Discounted Payback (i > 0): Uses discounted cash flows

**Calculation:**
1. Calculate cumulative (discounted) cash flows
2. Find when cumulative total crosses zero
3. Interpolate for exact crossing point

**Decision Rule:**
Accept if payback < maximum acceptable payback period

**Limitations:**
- Ignores cash flows after payback
- Simple payback ignores time value
- Doesn't measure profitability

**Use Cases:**
- Liquidity-constrained firms
- Projects with high uncertainty beyond near term
- Quick screening of projects

\examples{
# Simple payback: Investment 1000, annual returns 300
payback_period(c(-1000, 300, 300, 300, 300, 300), i = 0)
# Returns: 3.33 years

# Discounted payback at 10\%
payback_period(c(-1000, 300, 300, 300, 300, 300), i = 0.10)
# Returns: longer than simple payback

# Exam problem: Project payback
# Investment: 50,000€. Annual cash flows: 15,000€ for 5 years.
# Calculate simple and discounted (8\%) payback periods.
payback_period(c(-50000, rep(15000, 5)), i = 0)     # Simple
payback_period(c(-50000, rep(15000, 5)), i = 0.08)  # Discounted
