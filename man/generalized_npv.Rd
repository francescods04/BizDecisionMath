\title{Generalized Net Present Value (GNPV)}
\usage{
generalized_npv(cash_flows, times, spot_rates)
}
\arguments{
\item{cash_flows}{Numeric vector. The cash flows (including initial at t=0).}

\item{times}{Numeric vector. The times corresponding to cash flows.}

\item{spot_rates}{Numeric vector. The spot rates r(0, t) matching each time point. 
For t=0, the rate is irrelevant (usually 0).}
}
\value{
Numeric. The Generalized NPV.
}
\description{
Calculates NPV using a term structure of interest rates (spot rates) instead of a constant rate.
Formula: GNPV = Sum(CashFlow_t / (1 + r_t)^t)
}
