\title{Compound Discount (Present Value)}
\usage{
calc_compound_discount(
  S,
  i,
  t,
  verbose = getOption("BizDecisionMath.verbose", FALSE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{Numeric. The nominal/future value.}

\item{i}{Numeric. The annual interest rate (decimal).}

\item{t}{Numeric. The time in years.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, displays calculation steps.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The present value A.
}
\description{
Calculates the present value (A) of a future amount using compound discount.
This is the inverse of compound accumulation.
}
\details{
**Mathematical Formula:**
\deqn{A = S \times (1 + i)^{-t} = \frac{S}{(1 + i)^t}}

**Discount Factor:**
- v = (1 + i)^(-1) is the one-period discount factor
- v^t = (1 + i)^(-t) is the t-period discount factor

**Use Cases:**
- Valuing future cash flows (NPV analysis)
- Bond pricing
- Pension fund calculations

\examples{
# Basic usage: Present value of 1628.89€ due in 10 years at 5\%
calc_compound_discount(S = 1628.89, i = 0.05, t = 10)
# Returns: ~1000

# Exam problem: Zero-coupon bond pricing
# A zero-coupon bond pays 100,000€ at maturity in 5 years.
# Market interest rate is 6\%. What is the bond's price?
calc_compound_discount(S = 100000, i = 0.06, t = 5, verbose = TRUE)
