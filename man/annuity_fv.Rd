\title{Future Value of an Annuity}
\usage{
annuity_fv(
  R,
  i,
  n,
  type = "ordinary",
  verbose = getOption("BizDecisionMath.verbose", FALSE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{Numeric. The periodic payment amount.}

\item{i}{Numeric. The interest rate per period.}

\item{n}{Integer. The number of payment periods.}

\item{type}{Character. `"ordinary"` (default) or `"due"`.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, displays exam-style solution.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The future value of the annuity.
}
\description{
Calculates the accumulated (future) value of a series of equal periodic payments
at the time of the last payment.
}
\details{
**Mathematical Formulas:**

Ordinary Annuity:
\deqn{FV = R \times \frac{(1+i)^n - 1}{i} = R \times s_{\overline{n}|i}}

Due Annuity:
\deqn{FV = R \times \frac{(1+i)^n - 1}{i} \times (1+i) = R \times \ddot{s}_{\overline{n}|i}}

**Relationship to Present Value:**
FV = PV × (1+i)^n

**Use Cases:**
- Retirement savings planning
- Sinking fund calculations
- Education fund accumulation

\examples{
# Basic savings plan: 500€/month for 10 years at 0.4\% monthly
annuity_fv(R = 500, i = 0.004, n = 120)

# Exam problem: Retirement savings
# An employee saves 1000€/month for 30 years at 5\% annual rate.
# How much will they have at retirement?
monthly_rate <- calc_equivalent_rate(0.05, 12)
annuity_fv(R = 1000, i = monthly_rate, n = 360, verbose = TRUE)

# Compare ordinary vs due annuity
annuity_fv(R = 100, i = 0.01, n = 12, type = "ordinary")  
annuity_fv(R = 100, i = 0.01, n = 12, type = "due")  # Higher
