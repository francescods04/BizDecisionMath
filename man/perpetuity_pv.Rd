\usage{
perpetuity_pv(
  R,
  i,
  g = 0,
  type = "ordinary",
  deferral = 0,
  verbose = getOption("BizDecisionMath.verbose", FALSE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{Numeric. The payment amount (first payment for growing perpetuity).}

\item{i}{Numeric. The interest/discount rate (must be > g).}

\item{g}{Numeric. The growth rate (default 0 for constant perpetuity).}

\item{type}{Character. `"ordinary"` (default) or `"due"`.}

\item{deferral}{Integer. Number of periods to defer start (default 0).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, displays exam-style solution.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The present value of the perpetuity.
}
\description{
Calculates the present value of an infinite stream of payments.
Supports both constant perpetuities and growing perpetuities (Gordon Growth Model).
}
\details{
**Mathematical Formulas:**

Constant Perpetuity (g = 0):
\deqn{PV = \frac{R}{i}}

Growing Perpetuity / Gordon Growth Model (g > 0):
\deqn{PV = \frac{R}{i - g}}

**Convergence Condition:**
For the series to converge, we MUST have g < i.
If g ≥ i, the perpetuity has infinite present value.

**Gordon Growth Model Context:**
When used for stock valuation:
- R = Next year's dividend (D₁)
- i = Required rate of return
- g = Dividend growth rate
- PV = Stock price (P₀)

**Use Cases:**
- Stock valuation (Gordon Growth)
- Preferred stock pricing
- Endowment fund sizing
- Consol bond pricing

\examples{
# Constant perpetuity: 1000€/year forever at 5\%
perpetuity_pv(R = 1000, i = 0.05)
# Returns: 20,000

# Growing perpetuity: 1000€/year growing 2\% at 5\%
perpetuity_pv(R = 1000, i = 0.05, g = 0.02)
# Returns: 33,333

# Exam problem: Stock valuation using Gordon Growth
# A stock pays a dividend of 2€ next year, growing 3\% annually.
# If required return is 8\%, what should the stock price be?
perpetuity_pv(R = 2, i = 0.08, g = 0.03, verbose = TRUE)

# Deferred perpetuity: Endowment paying 50,000€/year starting in 10 years
perpetuity_pv(R = 50000, i = 0.04, deferral = 10)
