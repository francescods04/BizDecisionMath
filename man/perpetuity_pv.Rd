\usage{
perpetuity_pv(R, i, g = 0, type = "ordinary", deferral = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{Numeric. The payment amount (first payment for geometric).}

\item{i}{Numeric. The interest rate.}

\item{g}{Numeric. The growth rate (default 0 for constant perpetuity). Must be less than i.}

\item{type}{Character. "ordinary" or "due". Default "ordinary".}

\item{deferral}{Integer. Number of periods to defer start (default 0).}
}
\value{
Numeric. The present value.

\description{
Calculates PV of a perpetuity, optionally with constant growth (geometric).
Formula (Ordinary): PV = R / (i - g)
Formula (Due): PV = (R / (i - g)) * (1 + i)
}
