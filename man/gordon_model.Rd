\usage{
gordon_model(
  d,
  i,
  g,
  P_future = 0,
  n = Inf,
  verbose = getOption("BizDecisionMath.verbose", FALSE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Numeric. The next year's dividend (D₁).}

\item{i}{Numeric. The required rate of return (cost of equity).}

\item{g}{Numeric. The constant dividend growth rate.}

\item{P_future}{Numeric. Terminal stock price at year n (for finite horizon).}

\item{n}{Numeric. Number of years (Inf for infinite horizon).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, displays exam-style solution.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The intrinsic stock value P₀.
}
\description{
Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock based on future dividend payments.
Also known as the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) or Gordon-Shapiro Model.
}
\details{
**Mathematical Formulas:**

Infinite Horizon (standard Gordon Growth):
\deqn{P_0 = \frac{D_1}{i - g}}

Finite Horizon (with terminal value):
\deqn{P_0 = \frac{D_1}{i-g} \times \left[1 - \left(\frac{1+g}{1+i}\right)^n\right] + \frac{P_n}{(1+i)^n}}

**Key Assumptions:**
1. Dividends grow at a constant rate g forever
2. Required return i > growth rate g
3. Company pays dividends

**Relationship to Perpetuity:**
This is mathematically equivalent to a growing perpetuity.

**Limitations:**
- Not suitable for non-dividend paying stocks
- Assumes constant growth (may not hold)
- Sensitive to the g and i estimates

\examples{
# Basic usage: D₁ = 2€, required return 10\%, growth 3\%
gordon_model(d = 2, i = 0.10, g = 0.03)
# Returns: 28.57

# Exam problem: Stock valuation
# A company just paid a dividend of 1.50€. Dividends grow 4\% annually.
# If required return is 12\%, what is the stock worth?
# Note: d should be NEXT year's dividend = 1.50 * 1.04
gordon_model(d = 1.50 * 1.04, i = 0.12, g = 0.04, verbose = TRUE)

# Finite horizon: Hold for 5 years, then sell at P₅ = 50€
gordon_model(d = 2, i = 0.10, g = 0.03, P_future = 50, n = 5)
