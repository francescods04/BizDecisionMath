\title{Profitability Index (PI)}
\usage{
profitability_index(
  cash_flows,
  times = NULL,
  i,
  verbose = getOption("BizDecisionMath.verbose", FALSE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cash_flows}{Numeric vector. The cash flows (must include initial investment at t=0).}

\item{times}{Numeric vector. The times (default 0:(n-1)).}

\item{i}{Numeric. The discount rate.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints detailed calculation steps and interpretation.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The Profitability Index.
}
\description{
Calculates the Profitability Index, also known as the Benefit-Cost Ratio.
Measures the value created per unit of investment.
}
\details{
**Mathematical Formula:**
\deqn{PI = \frac{PV(\text{Future Inflows})}{\text{Initial Investment}}}
\deqn{PI = \frac{NPV + |C_0|}{|C_0|} = 1 + \frac{NPV}{|C_0|}}

**Decision Rule:**
- PI > 1: Accept project (equivalent to NPV > 0)
- PI < 1: Reject project
- PI = 1: Indifferent

**Use Cases:**
- Capital rationing: When budget is limited, rank projects by PI
- Comparing projects of different sizes

**Interpretation:**
A PI of 1.15 means for every 1€ invested, the project returns 1.15€ in present value terms.

\examples{
# Project: Invest 1000, receive 1200 in 1 year at 10\% rate
# PV(Inflow) = 1200/1.1 = 1090.9
# PI = 1090.9 / 1000 = 1.09
profitability_index(c(-1000, 1200), i = 0.10)

# Capital rationing exam problem:
# Choose between Project A (Cost 100, NPV 20) and Project B (Cost 50, NPV 15).
# PI_A = (120)/100 = 1.20
# PI_B = (65)/50 = 1.30
# Conclusion: Project B is more efficient per dollar invested.
profitability_index(c(-100, 132), i = 0.10) # A approx
