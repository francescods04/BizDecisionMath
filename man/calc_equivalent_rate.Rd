\title{Convert Between Annual and Periodic Interest Rates}
\usage{
calc_equivalent_rate(
  rate,
  m,
  type = "annual_to_periodic",
  verbose = getOption("BizDecisionMath.verbose", FALSE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{Numeric. The known interest rate (annual or periodic).}

\item{m}{Integer. Frequency of compounding per year.}

\item{type}{Character. Either `"annual_to_periodic"` (default) or `"periodic_to_annual"`.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, displays the formula and calculation steps.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The equivalent interest rate.
}
\description{
Converts between an effective annual interest rate (i) and a periodic rate (i_m)
that compounds m times per year. Essential for matching payment frequency with rate frequency.
}
\details{
**Mathematical Formulas:**

Annual to Periodic (given annual rate i, find periodic rate i_m):
\deqn{i_m = (1 + i)^{1/m} - 1}

Periodic to Annual (given periodic rate i_m, find annual rate i):
\deqn{i = (1 + i_m)^m - 1}

**Common Frequencies (m):**
- m = 12: Monthly
- m = 4: Quarterly
- m = 2: Semi-annual
- m = 365: Daily

**When to Use:**
Use `annual_to_periodic` when you have an annual rate but payments are monthly/quarterly.
Use `periodic_to_annual` when you have a monthly rate and need the effective annual rate.

\examples{
# Convert 6\% annual rate to monthly rate
calc_equivalent_rate(rate = 0.06, m = 12, type = "annual_to_periodic")
# Returns: 0.004868 (0.4868\% per month)

# Convert 0.5\% monthly rate to annual rate
calc_equivalent_rate(rate = 0.005, m = 12, type = "periodic_to_annual")
# Returns: 0.0617 (6.17\% effective annual rate)

# Exam problem: Mortgage rate conversion
# A mortgage advertises 6\% annual rate with monthly payments.
# What is the monthly rate to use in annuity calculations?
