\usage{
geom_annuity_pv(
  R,
  g,
  i,
  n,
  type = "ordinary",
  deferral = 0,
  verbose = getOption("BizDecisionMath.verbose", FALSE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{Numeric. The first payment amount.}

\item{g}{Numeric. The growth rate of payments per period (decimal).}

\item{i}{Numeric. The interest/discount rate per period (decimal).}

\item{n}{Integer. The number of payment periods.}

\item{type}{Character. `"ordinary"` (default) or `"due"`.}

\item{deferral}{Integer. Number of periods to defer the annuity (default 0).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, displays exam-style step-by-step solution.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The present value of the growing annuity.
}
\description{
Calculates the present value of an annuity where payments grow at a constant rate g
each period. Also known as a growing annuity or escalating payment annuity.
}
\details{
**Mathematical Formulas:**

Ordinary Growing Annuity (i ≠ g):
\deqn{PV = \frac{R}{i-g} \times \left[1 - \left(\frac{1+g}{1+i}\right)^n\right]}

Due Growing Annuity (i ≠ g):
\deqn{PV = \frac{R \times (1+i)}{i-g} \times \left[1 - \left(\frac{1+g}{1+i}\right)^n\right]}

Special Case (i = g):
\deqn{PV = \frac{n \times R}{1+i}}

**Payment Pattern:**
- Period 1: R
- Period 2: R(1+g)
- Period 3: R(1+g)²
- Period n: R(1+g)^(n-1)

**Use Cases:**
- Salary-indexed pension payments
- Inflation-adjusted income streams
- Leases with built-in rent increases

\examples{
# Basic usage: 10,000€ first payment, growing 2\%/year for 10 years at 5\%
geom_annuity_pv(R = 10000, g = 0.02, i = 0.05, n = 10)

# Exam problem: Pension valuation
# An employee will receive a pension starting at 30,000€/year,
# increasing 3\% annually for 20 years. Discount rate is 6\%.
# What is the present value of this pension?
geom_annuity_pv(R = 30000, g = 0.03, i = 0.06, n = 20, verbose = TRUE)

# Deferred growing annuity: pension starts in 5 years
geom_annuity_pv(R = 30000, g = 0.03, i = 0.06, n = 20, deferral = 5)
