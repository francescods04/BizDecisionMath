\title{Calculate Forward Rate from Spot Rates}
\usage{
spot_to_forward(
  spot_rate_s,
  spot_rate_k,
  t_s,
  t_k,
  verbose = getOption("BizDecisionMath.verbose", FALSE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spot_rate_s}{Numeric. Spot rate r(0,s) to time s.}

\item{spot_rate_k}{Numeric. Spot rate r(0,k) to time k.}

\item{t_s}{Numeric. Start time s (in years).}

\item{t_k}{Numeric. End time k (in years). Must be > t_s.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, displays exam-style solution.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The forward interest rate r(s,k).
}
\description{
Calculates the implied forward interest rate between two future dates
using the term structure of spot rates. Based on the no-arbitrage principle.
}
\details{
**Mathematical Formula:**
The no-arbitrage condition implies:
\deqn{(1 + r_{0,s})^s \times (1 + r_{s,k})^{k-s} = (1 + r_{0,k})^k}

Solving for the forward rate r(s,k):
\deqn{r_{s,k} = \left[\frac{(1 + r_{0,k})^k}{(1 + r_{0,s})^s}\right]^{\frac{1}{k-s}} - 1}

**Interpretation:**
- r(0,s) = Spot rate from today to time s
- r(0,k) = Spot rate from today to time k
- r(s,k) = Forward rate agreed today for borrowing/lending from s to k

**No-Arbitrage Principle:**
The forward rate is the rate that makes investing for k years directly
equivalent to investing for s years then reinvesting at the forward rate.

**Use Cases:**
- Pricing forward rate agreements (FRAs)
- Extracting market expectations of future rates
- Bond trading strategies

\examples{
# Basic usage: Given 1-year spot = 3\% and 2-year spot = 4\%,
# find the 1-year forward rate starting in 1 year
spot_to_forward(spot_rate_s = 0.03, spot_rate_k = 0.04, t_s = 1, t_k = 2)
# Returns: ~5.01\%

# Exam problem: Term structure analysis
# The current term structure shows:
# - 1-year spot rate: 2.5\%
# - 3-year spot rate: 3.5\%
# What is the implied forward rate from year 1 to year 3?
spot_to_forward(0.025, 0.035, 1, 3, verbose = TRUE)

# Verify no-arbitrage: Both paths should give same accumulation
# Direct: (1 + 0.04)^2 = 1.0816
# Indirect: (1 + 0.03)^1 * (1 + 0.0501)^1 ≈ 1.0816
